    <h1>The Poor People App</h1>
    <p>
      The social safety net is running on outdated software. While the middle class gets squeezed by inflation 
      and AI threatens entry-level jobs, the existing system offers nothing but bureaucratic runarounds and 
      programs you don't qualify for. We're building the alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>PPA is economic infrastructure for regular people.</strong> This isn't about charity—it's about 
      leverage. We're creating a platform where communities organize collectively, where your data becomes an 
      asset you control, and where transparent technology replaces inefficient bureaucracy. Think Uber's playbook 
      applied to human services: connecting people who need help with people who can provide it, powered by AI 
      agents that handle the complexity while keeping humans in control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-term vision includes tokenized incentives through Poor People Coin (PPC), Bitcoin-based inflation 
      protection, and a network powerful enough that politicians can't ignore it. But right now? We're in the 
      building phase—proving there's demand, assembling the team, and doing this the right way with full legal 
      compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is economic mobilization disguised as an app.</strong> The first supporters aren't just 
      users—they're founding members of a movement to upgrade how America takes care of its own.

  <h2>WHY BITCOIN</h2>
</div>

  <div class="bitcoin-content">
    <h3>Sound Money for an Uncertain Future</h3>
    <p>
      Your paycheck buys less every month. The government prints trillions, inflation steals your purchasing 
      power, and traditional savings accounts get destroyed by monetary policy you have no control over. 
      <strong>Bitcoin is the hedge.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Censorship-Resistant Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      Banks freeze accounts. Payment processors deplatform organizations. Centralized systems have single 
      points of failure controlled by people who don't answer to you. Bitcoin is permissionless—no one can 
      stop you from holding it, sending it, or building on top of it. For a platform serving people the 
      system already ignores, that's not a luxury. <strong>It's a necessity.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Bitcoin's Role in PPA</h3>
    <p>
      We're exploring Bitcoin as the foundation for PPA's treasury reserves. As platform revenue grows, 
      we accumulate Bitcoin—not because we're gambling on price increases, but because it's the only 
      asset governments can't print more of when it's politically convenient. When inflation hits and 
      service costs spike, a Bitcoin-backed treasury means PPA can keep operating while traditional 
      organizations scramble for emergency funding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't about getting rich. <strong>It's about building something that can't be shut down 
      when we become inconvenient.</strong> The middle class needs infrastructure that works when 
      traditional systems fail. Bitcoin makes that possible.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Support the Mission</h3>
    <p>
      We're launching a GiveSendGo campaign to fund initial development, legal structuring, and team assembly. 
      This is software development funding—not an investment opportunity, not a token presale. If you believe 
      working Americans deserve better tools to organize and protect themselves economically, your support 
      makes this possible.
    </p>
    <p class="campaign-notice">
      <strong>Campaign launching soon.</strong> Stay connected for updates.
