        <p>
          I’m an innovative full-stack developer and multimedia specialist with over 4 years of experience 
          in Unity/C#, Python, and Adobe Creative Suite. I excel at crafting AI-integrated applications, 
          interactive digital experiences, and automated solutions that marry technical precision with 
          creative flair. My background in client relations and project coordination lets me bridge the gap 
          between technical and non-technical worlds seamlessly.
        </p>

          From startups to nonprofits, I’ve led technical initiatives, designed scalable systems, and 
          delivered multimedia content that inspires. My passion lies in empowering others—whether through 
          custom development services or community-driven projects like Pythos.
